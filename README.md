# car-booking-page

Hi guys,
Myself Harish Jayaprakash, student at Bannari Amman Institute of Technology.
I have herewith attached the code for car booking page designed using HTML, CSS. I have designed 4 different web pages for Audi, Mercedes, Ford and Jaguar respectively. 
AUDI1, FORD1, JAGUAR1 and MERCEDES! are the index pages of these pages. I am just a beginner in this particular field. So I feel happy to share my piece of work here. 
Only the login page redirects you to a different URL whereas the rest of the buttons are dummy.
Hope you like this design. Thanks for visiting my repository. 
Happy Learning 😁✌️
